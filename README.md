# Smart-Predictive-Modeling-for-Rental-Property-Prices

Overview
This project aims to develop a smart predictive model to estimate rental property prices based on various features such as property size, location, amenities, and more. By leveraging machine learning techniques, the goal is to provide accurate rental price estimates to property owners, tenants, and real estate professionals.

Features

Data Collection: Gather comprehensive data on rental properties, including size, location, amenities, proximity to key locations, etc.

Data Preprocessing: Clean, preprocess, and transform the dataset to prepare it for modeling.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Perform in-depth EDA to understand the underlying patterns, trends, and relationships within the data.

Feature Engineering: Create new features, encode categorical variables, handle missing values, and normalize data where necessary.

Model Development: Build and train machine learning models using various algorithms such as Linear Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, etc.

Evaluation Metrics: Evaluate model performance using appropriate metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-squared.

Deployment & Monitoring: Deploy the model into a production environment and continuously monitor its performance to ensure accuracy and reliability.
